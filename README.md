## Planning

#### The process story

This is my first personally developed and launched application. Going into this project I had some big dreams, and while what you see above is not what i had originally envisioned, I am proud of it. 
Originally I had envisioned a board with 2 trays of pieces which can be dragged and dropped onto the board in-place of clicking. I also wanted to make it StarWars themed.
Needless to say, I was feeling ambitious. Both of these where abandoned as the project progressed in favor of completing the app by the deadline. First I realized that as I started researching the drag and drop implementations that the structure of my event logic would not be easily changed to accommodate for that transition. The StarWars theme was abandoned because I ran out of time for implementing styles and finding the resources legally was proving a challenge, and also a bit of a grey area.
Another feature I struggled with was implementing the bootstrap 5.0 modals. I ran into some difficulty making the submission buttons on the forms also close the modals they are in. However, this was time well spent and makes a nice smooth user experience in app. 
I learned a lot about the development process doing this project and how crucial it is to plan for the accommodation of desired features before diving into the project. Also: documentation is our best friend.
Thank you for ready my development story, adn I hope you enjoyed the app
